Dungeon Adventures : Untold Story 

This is my pure java practice project from a tutorial
and my ideas. I am using own and downloaded tiles
so far for rendering using javax.This is an 2D
adventure RPG game. The player can move around 
the map, pick up and interact with objects.

The code is under development.

In the future the game will hold NPC, enemy, more tiles,
 objects ,events ,quests and even local multiplayer.
I would like to be able to connect to different
kind of databases (Postgre, No-SQL).

If you have any ideas or opinions to share about
the game please send an e-mail here:
