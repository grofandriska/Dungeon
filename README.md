UpDungeon Adventures : Untold Story 

This is my pure java practice project from a youtube tutorial
and my ideas. I am using own and downloaded tiles
so far for rendering using javax.This is an 2D
adventure RPG game. The player can move around 
the map, pick up Objects and interact npcs .

The code is under development.

In the future the game will hold NPC, enemy, more tiles,
 objects ,events ,quests and even local multiplayer.
I would like to be able to connect to different
kind of databases (Postgre, No-SQL).

If you have any ideas or opinions to share about
the game please send an e-mail here:
